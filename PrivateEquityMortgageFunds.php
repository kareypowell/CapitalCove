										The Capital Cove Private Equity Group (“CCPEG”) invests in control-based, private equity  transactions in select 
										Residential and Commercial properties with the objective of generating  substantial medium to long-term equity 
										appreciation in our investment-grade portfolios. The firm specializes in opportunistic and distressed asset

										client base, and the sponsored Private Equity Funds for individual and institutional investors. Historically,

										select international markets.  <br /><br />

										<strong>Investment Strategies To Consider:</strong>
										<br /> </p>

										<blockquote><p><strong>•	Capital Cove REO Opportunities Fund:</strong> The firm’s flagship Private Equity Fund; 
											This Fund offers one of the highest preferred return rates in the industry with relatively short commitment periods, 
											and is ideal for investors looking for a streamlined, transparent and equity-based vehicle to passively invest in 
											foreclosure properties.</p></blockquote>


										<blockquote><p><strong>•	Capital Cove REO Fixed Income Plans: </strong>With a fixed, double-digit annualized return, 
											these plans may be redeemed annually or used to quickly build up a highly attractive and top performing 
											portfolio. </p></blockquote>


										<blockquote><p><strong>•	Capital Cove Joint Venture Partnerships: </strong>Invest or co-invest with Capital Cove in 
											single asset or multi-asset portfolio purchases directly from principal owners and selling entities. This vehicle 
											is available to vetted individuals and qualified firms with experience in the foreclosure or alternative investments 
											industry.</p></blockquote>
