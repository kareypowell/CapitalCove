                        The Capital Cove Entrepreneurship and Development Initiative<br /><br />

Through the Global Zakat Charitable Foundation and several leading Donor-Advised Funds, Capital Cove Financial is committed to supporting the communities where we work and live. We always seek to apply our real estate and investment expertise to contribute to the success of a range of investment vehicles, qualified projects, and organizations that have demonstrated an innovative approach to improving the infrastructure, educational and economic conditions of underserved communities. Several key sectors in which we seek to invest, develop or finance include:

                                           Working directly with individuals, institutions, advisors and lenders, we have developed a highly tactical approach to charitable giving as it relates to strategic use of time, real estate assets, money and resources. We work hard to develop and execute intelligent, useful and ethical assistance, delivered in a manner that works best for all parties. 
                                           </p>
                 

                                           <p>
                                          In addition to its primary focus on real estate, entrepreneurship and alternative investments, the Foundation makes numerous grants, monetary credits and co-investments to support charitable projects. Moreover, the firm's employees and partners give generously of their time in an effort to deliver a bigger impact on civic, real estate and charitable organizations that support real estate and infrastructure development in the communities where Capital Cove's employees, clients and investors live and work.
