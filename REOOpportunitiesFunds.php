                        The <strong>Capital Cove REO Opportunities Fund</strong> has been vetted,
                        qualified and registered by the BRE, FDIC, HUD, FINRA, SEC and other government
                        agencies and corporate entities to purchase discounted loans, foreclosure
                        real estate and REO assets directly. During the last six years, the Principals
                        and Executive Managers of the Fund have developed significant relationships with
                        industry-leading alternative asset management firms, banks, private equity firms,
                        loan servicers, builders, accredited investors and private owners, whose troubled
                        realty and mortgage assets need to be liquidated quickly at significant discounts.
                        Through 2016, we fully expect the pace of bank closures, portfolio liquidations,
                        and private recapitalizations to accelerate dramatically. At Capital Cove, we are
                        100% focused on acquiring the right asset, at the right price, with the right exit
                        strategy for our individual and institutional investors.

                              Capital Cove provides active and entrepreneurial investors opportunities to
                              acquire distressed REO Real Estate assets at substantial discounts to current
                              market values - in addition to direct foreclosure lending opportunities that
                              deliver double-digit annualized returns.

                              Alternative Investments such as distressed Real Estate are generating significantly
                              higher investment yields and profit spreads than traditional investments such as
                              stocks, bonds and mutual funds; Savvy investors are using Self-Directed IRAs,
                              Separately Managed Accounts, Real Estate Funds and Private Lending vehicles to
                              capitalize on these opportunistic investment opportunities.

                              According to RealtyTrac and the U. S. Federal Reserve, projected year end foreclosures
                              will top 2,300,000 housing units nationwide; over one-third of these foreclosures will
                              be repossessed by the lender based on industry averages.

                              Homes in foreclosure that remain vacant drive up crime, impose direct costs on local

                              and home equity for adjacent properties.
