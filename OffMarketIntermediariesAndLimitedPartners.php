       <strong>   Proven investment and foreclosure expertise on your side of the transaction. </strong> <br />
At Capital Cove, we believe the continued strong and consistent growth of our businesses can accelerate quicker with the trusted association of real estate entrepreneurs, contracted fiduciaries, and our global network of professional investors, advisors and affiliated partner firms. Our long-term relationships with registered intermediaries and referral consultants create a true sense of working with one another, in a non-competitive and principal-direct manner, to help achieve successful outcomes for the buyer, seller or investor of a real estate-owned asset. If you are the titled owner or lien holder of an off-market, for sale by owner (FSBO), or principal-direct transaction, we would like to hear from you. You may also register your opportunity on this website, email your opportunity to reo@capitalcove.com, or request a New Client Registration form from our office staff.
