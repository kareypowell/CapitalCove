                          <h3>Joining The Best Minds And Managers In The Business</h3><br>
                         We look for professional candidates, executives and entrepreneurs with a strong interest or background in global capital markets, portfolio management, real estate services, alternative asset management, loss mitigation/default asset management or similar financial services background. We also consider individuals that are likely to thrive in our corporate culture, since a key to Capital Cove's continued success is how well we work together, deliver for our clients and exceed industry benchmarks set forth by the best and top performing firms in our industry.
Since inception, Capital Cove has effectively aligned its interests with those of its Investor and Principal Owner clients, and other professionals who have seen their successes drive the firm's success. As evidence of that alignment, since 2006 the firm and its wholly owned subsidiaries have completed hundreds of REO investment, real estate and foreclosure engagements – closing transactions across each and every recognized REO asset class in the industry.
