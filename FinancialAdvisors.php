            <strong> Fiduciary Solutions & Alternative Investment Outsourcing </strong><br />
 
Capital Cove provides a flexible and turnkey asset-based solution designed to protect capital, mitigate risk, and meet your evolving needs.       <br /><br />

Let's face it – you are not just a broker. You are an entrusted partner in your client's success. And you certainly do not want to be looped into the morass of "broker daisy chains", "seller or buyer mandates", and "ncnd paper shufflers" that often permeate the REO real estate investment industry. At Capital Cove, we understand the importance of listening and responding to your concerns quickly – and making the changes designed to keep your client's portfolio or asset operating at optimal performance. We help you to create a customized solution for clients when it comes to setting the course for your organization's alternative investment program. And we leave it up to you to decide how you want to work with us.

<strong>Alternative Investment Outsourcing (AIO) </strong><br /><br />
 
Our AIO solutions for fiduciary firms and practice sectors focus on the most profitable area of alternative investments in the industry - real estate-owned (REO) and foreclosure-based solutions. Often comprised of a mix of REO real estate funds, high-yield private mortgages, separately managed accounts, or equity joint venture partnerships, our REOAdvisorDirect™program pulls all of our investment core capabilities into a single, transparent platform for you and your clients.

<strong>Capital Cove - REO Real Estate Platform </strong><br /><br />
 
Today's real estate and mortgage marketplace demands a flexible, dynamic approach that delivers better returns than traditional investments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds and exchange traded funds. REO and foreclosure-based investments in particular, require more vigilant monitoring to quickly identify and take advantage of the right acquisition opportunities as they arise – in real-time with expedited due diligence. At Capital Cove, our REO Real Estate Platform delivers the best high-yield opportunities for individual and institutional investors.  Our diverse range of REO real estate offerings delivered through our platform include:
