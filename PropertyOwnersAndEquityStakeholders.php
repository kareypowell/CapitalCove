                         Let's focus on the real goals and disposition strategies that solve your problem. <BR /> <Br />
 
At Capital Cove, we stand with real property owners and equity stakeholders as true business partners in the strongest sense of the term. Whether you are a private property owner, investor, private lender, or an entity guided by an advisor's personalized advice, we believe our value-added services provide the best way to reach your desired outcomes. Our strong experience with all property types and default scenarios, and verifiable closings in every REO real estate asset class, allows us to deliver immediate capital allocation, streamlined acquisition to disposition solutions, and turnkey REO asset management solutions to real property owners nationwide â€“ either with or without the assistance of traditional real estate agents or brokers.

                      <p>
                   <strong>   Why should property owners and equity stakeholders care about multi-asset REO solutions? </strong><br /><br />
 
The real estate marketplace has changed dramatically - and now includes the explosive growth of new industry dynamics such as the entry of institutional Wall Street firms, offers from all-cash international buyers, increased off-market/for sale by owner transactions, and new internet realty firms and tech savvy service companies that are able to close real estate transactions quicker, better and less expensively than traditional brokerage firms.
                      </p>

 
                      <p>
                      If you are a goal-oriented and active property owner or investor, then we think you should consider multi-asset REO real estate solutions. As the name implies, Capital Cove looks at your real estate asset or portfolio from multiple angles, and devises the optimal acquisition, management or disposition solution for you or your organization. In addition to superior standard real estate services and REO asset management solutions, Capital Cove offers property owners and equity stakeholders:
